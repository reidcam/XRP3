            <p>This week we decided to pivot and change the direction of the project. We are no longer gonig to be making a
                VR exercise platform, instead we are making an application to teach the fundamentals of scuba diving. The main idea
                behind the application is that we will teach users the basics of communication and movement while scuba diving.
                Then, we will give them common tasks that you will run into while scuba diving in order to test their knowledge
                of the basics. We are doing this in order to make learning how to scuba dive more accessible to those who don't
                want to have to travel and buy a bunch of equipment to try scuba diving out.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This week we have started to create a new tutorial level where the user will learn how to move and communicate
                while scuba diving. We are currently in progress of creating hand recognition software to recognize when the user
                has sucessfully done a communication gesture. This software is essential because the application is meant for one
                person, so there is not another person there who is able to interpret the sign.

                The current tutorial level consists of an ocean like environment free of obstacals for the user to move around in.
                Next week, we plan to add some more decoration to make the tutorial environment feel more immsersive. In addition,
                we plan to start to create the first couple of task levels where the user can gain confidence in their basic 
                scuba diving skills in practical situations.

            <p>Welcome to the first dev blog of the project! In this week's dev blog we are going to cover
                what the project is and what features the team as started to implement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project is a VR athletic training companion. Do away with exspensive, bulky machines and instead pop on
                your VR headset and get all of the same training all in one spot. The main focus of this project is to
                replace reaction, coordination, and speed workouts that don't require weights. These types of workouts are
                easily recreatable in VR and allow the team to have a high degree of customization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first features the team started working on are a button reaction workout, juggling workout, a main hub,
                and color blind mode. We want the user to be easily able to navigate between different workouts, to accomplish
                this the team is working to develope a main hub where all of the different workouts can be accessed from so that
                the user can get a sense for what all of the different workouts are and pick which ever one they want to try out.

                The button reaction workout is the first workout that the team has focused on implementing and was the core
                inspiration for the projcet. It is inspired by machines like the one pictured above. Different buttons light
                up and you have to hit them. The team is working to recreate this game by creating buttons that appear around
                the user that will light up and make a sound when you need to hit them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next is the juggling workout. The team decided to work on a juggling outwork as the second workout for the
                project to provide a different type of outwork. The main goal of the juggling workout is to improve hand-eye
                coordination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last feature the team started work on this week was implementing a color blindness mode. We wanted to
                start out working on accessibility along the way in development to ensure that the final product is
                accessible for everyone. The main use of the color blindness mode at the moment is for the lights in the
                button reaction workout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for tuning in to this weeks dev blog. We will be writing these posts weekly throughout the development
                of the project.
