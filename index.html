            <h2>What is Deep Dive?</h2>
            <p>
                Deep Dive is a VR application for learning the basics of how to scuba dive. The application starts out
                by teaching the user how to communicate and move around while scuba diving and then presents them with
                tasks in order to gain confidence in their scuba diving skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Allow us to take you on a journey to the ocean from the comfort of your home where you can suite up and
                go scuba diving without all of the hassle of traveling and dealing with exspensive equipment. Together
                with your help we aim to create a community of divers to spread the knowledge of scuba diving.
